# The Header of both main.html and coldplay.html

For the logo image a 360 degree rotation with increase and decrease in size effect has been added.

then we have station section and other sections.
FOR RESPONSIVENESS:
The aside section moves down after a particular point.
Also after some particular point some section in main tag with flex direction as row changes to column to make it visible properly rest other things are adjusting accordinly.

Also after a particular decrease in screen size the band image covers the background and description lies on the top of it instead of they both being side by side as they were
previously.

All styling is added in style.css file in proper order and with quick description.
